#summary instructions to build and install SAGE on Unix-type systems: Linux, Mac OS X, and Solaris.

----

== Prerequisite ==
For SAGE: the runtime and development packages of the following libraries

    * SDL 1.2.8 or later : http://www.libsdl.org 
    Most Linux distributions include the SDL runtime package in default and the development package as an option. 

    * readline 5.0 or later : http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html 
    Most Linux distributions include the readline runtime package in default and the development package as an option. 


For SAGE UI components:
    * python 2.3 or later
    * wxPython 2.6.2 or later
    * Numpy or Numeric 

----

== Setup environment ==
 # Set an environment variable SAGE_DIRECTORY in your login profile: .profile, .bashrc, .tcshrc, and so on.
{{{
  setenv SAGE_DIRECTORY sage_path (for tcsh or similar)
  export SAGE_DIRECTORY=sage_path (for bash or similar)
  'sage_path' is the path to the root directory of your SAGE installation. 
  If you install SAGE3.0 in {$HOME}/local, sage_path is {$HOME}/local/sage3.0.
}}}
 # Add $SAGE_DIRECTORY/bin to your PATH in your login profile

  set path=($SAGE_DIRECTORY/bin $path)   (for tcsh or similar)
  export PATH=$SAGE_DIRECTORY/bin:$PATH  (for bash or similar)

----

== Modify build configuration ==

 # Open config.mk in SAGE_DIRECTORY
 #

----

== Compile ==

 # Execute make in SAGE_DIRECTORY
 # If you get errors, check include paths and library paths in make files in subdirectories
 # Execute make install in SAGE_DIRECTORY
