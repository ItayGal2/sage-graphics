CHANGELOG for Vol-a-tile
------------------------
Shalini Venkataraman, Luc Renambot
Tues Sep 23
-----------
- Use Tab/backspace to cycle across the different geometry
Mon Sep 22
----------
- added anim of volume data
- the 3rd argument of -v specifies the thumbnail volume, if not there, theres no thumbnail vol to be displayed

Sat Sep 20
----------
- added thumbnail for the fullres volume
- removed dependant texture from the renderer , its in main now
- add support for anim of isosurface, 

Wed/Thus sep 18
---------------
- Add a pointer to select for the various render objects
- fixed isosurface bug(GL_NORMALIZE)
- fixed bugs in the sliceview mapping to volume mapping
- use the mouse to click a point on the sliceview to move the probe

Sun Sep 14
----------
- fixed bug in accesing optistore (bounds for crop should be inclusive)
- added the 3 sliceviews and the probe to access the volume, isosurface is generated based on the current value in the probe
- add menu for cut-plane/object/roam/probe 

Thur Sep 11
----------
- added isosurface and point rendering, these objects are added at the mouse pointer
- increase/ decrease isovalues

Wed Sep 10
----------
- 2d hist is sent to TFUI everytime a new volume is roamed

Mon Sep 8
---------
- integrated Optistore, if V_NETDATA, files are loaded from Optiserver, else from local file
- added keys for roaming the volume, to activate roaming press key 'R'
- volume class has 2 children vFileVolume and vOptiVolume to handle the 2 different cases
- have a 1d histogram instead of 2d histogram

Sun Sep 7
---------
- Added mmap instead of reading from file 

Thu Sep 4
---------
- added a save/load for the gradient volumes
-g to load the gradient file (8bit)
'G' key to write the gradient into to a file (8bit)
- added save/load for the transfer functions from UI
use a ppm file to store texture as 1xn for the timebeing
- 'b' key to toggle display of bounding box
- save/load LUTs from the GUI(very primitive)

Tue Sep 2
---------
- added QUANTA tcp to transmit transfer functions
have a shared buffer betwen the TFUI/network thread
- when a tcp client(tfUI) connects to volvis, send the histogram of the volume to the UI

Thu Aug 28
----------
- keyboard rotation for volume/cutplane - done
- added clipplane
- reshuffled code 

Thu Aug 21
----------
- added MPI to distribute the rendering on the tiles - high latency
Is it possible to decouple the MPI from the display (dont think so)
- also tried using QUANTA instead of MPI - check for any difference
Its worse as expected
- added a QUANTA DB server for the TF to transmit to all tiles
(change this so that tf only transmits to master and master broadcasts to all slaves)

Thu Aug 14
----------
- separate TF/ volvis app
Flow something like this
Init
Volvis -> TFAPP : Histogram of volume data
Every network loop
TFAPP -> Volvis : 2d array for the transfer function

Thu Aug 7
---------
- add the TF widget to the volvis app
- added histogram plot of the data/gradient

July 31
-------
- Luc added CG Fragment shader for the transfer functions
