sagepdf is a PDF viewer for a tiled display running SAGE.

Prerequisites to compile include poppler, cairo and gtk+.
To build the full version, run:
	make

To install the compiled sagepdf application
(into $SAGE_DIRECTORY/bin), run:
	make install


To display a PDF on both local and tiled displays,
run:
	sagepdf /full/path/to/yourfile.pdf [-show_original] [-page num] [-scale num]

The PDF filename is a mandatory argument; the remainder are optional.
	-show_original
means no DXT compression is used

	-page num
(num is some integer) denotes which page number
should be displayed at startup

	-scale num
(num is some integer) denotes a scaling factor
to be applied _before_ the conversion from pdf to bitmap
is made for the tiled display (defaults to 4). The
scaling factor has no effect on the locally displayed
output.

To run just on the desktop, build with the command:
	make nosage

No connection to a tiled display is (or can be) made
when running this version. This may be useful for
experimenting with just the gui code.


Interaction with the local pdf window is, firstly,
via the keyboard:
	Home			= go to 1st page
	End			= go to last page
	Page Up, Left Arrow	= go back 1 page
	Page Down, Right Arrow	= go forward 1 page

The local pdf window also responds to the same mouse events
as the tiled display instance:
	Left Click	= go forward 1 page
	Drag Right	= go forward pages while dragging
	Right Click	= go back 1 page
	Drag Left	= go back pages while dragging
