juxtaconfig.conf - Determines viewports of slave, display nodes.

First line is the number of slave, display nodes. Each following line is the
normalized viewport coordinates (0.0 - 1.0) for x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max.
Origin is the upper left corner of the screen. Then follows a flag 
indicating which sides of the viewport to draw a border to.

NOTE: It would be nice if a tile-config library could convert between, pixels
and normalized coordinates, and convert between different origins as well.


juxtadata.conf - Describes the data.

First line: x, y origin of the data and the width and height of the data. Data
refers to the entire, huge image. The origin is always the upper left corner
of the data.

Second line: x, y position of the starting location in the data. This is where
the application starts.

Third line: slow_pan amount, fast_pan amount.

Fourth line: width, height of data extent to fetch. This should be the size
of the SAGE window.

Fifth line: scale factor for overview file given to UI

Sixth line: path of overview file for the dataset for UI


juxtalayout.conf

Data layout specification file used by GlobalCoordinatesToFileMapper class.

First line: width, height of entire, huge image.

Second line: number_columns, number_rows of tiles that make up the entire, huge
image.

Thrid line: dim_x, dim_y of each file. This assumes that all files are the same
size. This should change in the future.

Following lines: Files that make up the entire, huge image. Specified column
by column from the top of the column down. So in the sample file

/home/evl/schwarz/data/16tdn155040.tif
/home/evl/schwarz/data/16tdn155025.tif
/home/evl/schwarz/data/16tdn155010.tif

is the left most column, where /home/evl/schwarz/data/16tdn155040.tif is the
top row in that column, and /home/evl/schwarz/data/16tdn155010.tif is the
bottom row in that column.


juxtauiserver.conf - config file used by JuxtaUIServer class.

port to listen for incoming connections.


juxtaclient.conf - config file used by JuxtaView Client UI.

IP_address : port_number of server
